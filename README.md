# ETF Analysis
## About the project
My mum recently suggested me to have a look at investing & ETFs, I thought it seemed interesting so I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn more about how the maths and data supports decisions made on the financial market.

This project follows the full data-science lifecycle—collecting and cleaning historical price data, engineering meaningful features, and applying statistical models and portfolio optimization techniques—to deliver a series of targeted analyses. 

The model consists of 3 parts beyond the cleaning and EDA:

`Moving average analysis`  
`ARIMA forecasting`  
`Markowitz modern portfolio optimization`
