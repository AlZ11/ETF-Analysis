# ETF Analysis
## About the project
My mum recently suggested me to have a look at investing & ETFs, I thought it seemed interesting so I wanted to learn more about how the maths and data supports  decisions made on the financial market.

This project follows the full data-science lifecycle—collecting and cleaning historical price data, engineering meaningful features, and applying statistical models and portfolio optimization techniques—to deliver a series of targeted analyses. 

The model consists of 3 parts beyond the cleaning and EDA:

Moving average analysis
ARIMA forecasting
Markowitz modern portfolio optimization
